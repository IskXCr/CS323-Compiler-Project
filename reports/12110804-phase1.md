## Compile

Before: `make clean`

Then: `make ` or `make splc`.



## Basic Feature List

All implemented.



## Extended Feature List

### Error Detection

- Hanging else

- Invalid function definition inside functions

- Various errors about missing parenthesis/square bracket:

  Run parser on `test/test_12110804_2.spl` for details on missing square brackets.

- Various errors about missing operands:

- Errors about invalid constant form:

  ![image-20231028221130144](../images/img-5.png)

  

### Other SPL Parser Features

- Optimized error/warning output

  **This may cause the `diff`** **utility not to work when doing batch verifying**, as ASCII control sequences are used to color the output and they will not be recognized by `diff`.

  **The output parsing tree will not get colored.**

  *This is done by using ASCII control sequences and reusable file descriptors. **Some of the SPL grammar structure is modified, but the target language does not change.***

  - `StmtList` *and* `DefList` *now **cannot** be empty.*

- Allowing unary operators: `+/-`, unary prefix/postfix operator: `++/--`

  Run parser on `test/test_5.spl` for details.

- Allowing `for` loop declaration

  - Allow any type of for loop combination:

    ```c
    for ([optional definition]; [optional expression]; optional expression)
        stmt
    ```

  *This is done by decomposing the for loop into **loop body** and **statement***.

  Run parser on `test_ex/test_6.spl` for details.

- Allowing the following floating-point declaration, given by `[0-9]*\.[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?`:

  ```c
  float y = .3e-13;
  ```

  Run parser on `test-ex/test_3.spl` for details.

- Allowing single-line/cross-line comments

  ```c
  int main()
  {
      int a = 0; // This is a single comment.
      int b = 0; // This is a cross-line comment \
                    as you can tell by changing the language server interpreting this comment to match the C language.
      int c = 233; // Hi! C
      /*
      This is a cross-line comment.
      */
      int d = c;
      /* Hi!
      */
     
      */ // This is a hanging comment, which should not be recognized
  }
  ```

  *This is done by assigning* `yylex` *with specific states*.

  Run parser on `test-ex/test_4.spl` for details.

- Allow single-line/cross-line strings:

  - Allowed escape characters: `\[abefnrtv\'"?]`

  ```c
  int main()
  {
      char msg1 = "Hi Just want to test!";
  
      char msg2 = "Hi \
                      Just want to test!";
  
      char msg3 = "Hi"
                  "Thanks!";
      printf("[%s]", msg);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  *This is done by assigning* `yylex` *with specific states*.

  Run parser on `test-ex/test_5.spl` for details.

There are other tests that do hybrid testing. You may check them out individually.
